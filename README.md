# XMC4800
XMC4800 Peripheral interface library generated from an SVD

## WARNING

The inclusion of EtherCAT has been removed from `src/lib.rs`. This is due to an issue either with the SVD file or the generation of the code using svd2rust. There is no support at this time until a fix can be made. This has not been tested on hardware to ensure that nothing else has been impacted.
